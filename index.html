            <h3> Home life</h3>
            </p> I am a Junior at Monacan Highschool. I am also the middle child out of the three kids in my household.
            I
            have
            an older sister and a younger brother. I would say being a middle kid has definitely influenced me in
            various
            ways.
            Throughout my educational career I have always had a buddy, with my sister 2 grades ahead of me and my
            brother 1
            behind me. I have never had to face a situation in school alone. Well..until 2022. With my sister graduated
            and
            my
            brother at a completely different school than me, for the first time since birth I would truly face the
            beast of
            individuality. Although it has been a tedious journey of self discovery it nonetheless has been a necessary
            one.
            Despite the dependency of comradery from my siblings, independence never scared me. Being cradled between 2
            people
            has definitely brought out the extrovert in me. When you are in the middle you tend to blend into the crowd
            a
            lot
            easier. So being loud and vibrant and original has constantly been my way of sticking out.

            </p>
            For school i Attend the humanities speality center at monacan highschol. Here I have gaind the knowledeg of
            working
            with those i do not always agree with. Throughout my expeirence in the center I discovered that the ciriculum was very eurocentric and did not relfeclt the mission statment of creating vast knowledge on "the human experience". With this i brought a challenge to 3 of my close friends, How do we fix this? Febuary 10th 2021 Hummanities Change was launched. NOw we are an active team speaking at facuilty meets drafting up solutions and creating ways to better our learning. I am involved in Chesterfield Young Leaders for Change, BIPOC,And Tutoring.`
